    <p1> In football, for example, after Panini sold the 2018 World Cup series of star CARDS, a large number of shops bought them at wholesale prices. Each carton is one unit, and each carton has different amounts of hits. Because there are a total of 32 teams in the World Cup, so the shop will type out the names of the 32 teams, and marked the price for buyers to buy. So the buyer buys all the CARDS in the box about one of the teams. For example, if I buy CARDS for the 2018 World Cup host Russia, then after the store removes the box of CARDS, all the CARDS for the Russian players are my assets. As the strength of different teams is not the same, the international influence of the players is not the same, resulting in the card secondary market price is not the same. These are all factors that affect the price of each team's CARDS.</p1>

    <p2>In sports-style Trading Cards, you can buy the initials of players in addition to buying the team and thus getting the card. There are 26 letters in English, and there will be 26 buyers participating in this activity. Each buyer will buy a letter, and the player whose name begins with that letter in the box will be owned by the buyer.</p2>
