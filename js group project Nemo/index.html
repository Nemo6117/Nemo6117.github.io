          <p class="info">
            Cantonese cuisine is Guangdong cuisine, which is one of the four
            major cuisines and eight major cuisines in China.
          </p>
          <p class="info">
            In a narrow sense, Cantonese cuisine refers to Cantonese cuisine (ie
            Guangzhou House cuisine), and in a broad sense it includes Chaozhou
            cuisine (Chaoshan cuisine) and Dongjiang cuisine (also known as
            Hakka cuisine).
          </p>
          <p class="info">
            Cantonese cuisine originated from the Central Plains, inheriting the
            Central Plains food style advocated by Confucius, "Eat is not tired
            of fine, eat is not tired of fine", so the practice of Cantonese
            cuisine is more complicated and delicate，<br />For example, the
            claypot rice and roast suckling pig in Cantonese cuisine originated
            from the "Eight Treasures" cuisine of the Zhou Dynasty;<br />Roast
            goose originated from roast duck, a famous dish in the Song Dynasty;
            after the dim sum spread from the Central Plains to Guangdong, it
            evolved into today's Cantonese-style dim sum such as shrimp
            dumplings and dry steamed siomai.

                Shaoguan, Zhanjiang and other places. It has the characteristics
                of clear, fresh, cool, tender, smooth and so on. Cantonese
                cuisine is the representative of Cantonese cuisine. Since
                ancient times, it has the reputation of "eat in Guangzhou, cook

                The formation and development of Cantonese cuisine is closely
                related to the geographical environment, economic conditions and
                customs of Guangdong. Guangdong is located in the subtropical
                zone, on the verge of the South China Sea, with abundant
                rainfall, evergreen seasons and rich products. Therefore,
                Guangdong's food has always been blessed by nature. As early as
                the Western Han Dynasty, "Huainanzi Spiritual Chapter" contained
                the fine and extensive selection of Cantonese cuisine
                ingredients, and it is conceivable that the Cantonese people
                more than a thousand years ago were able to cook different odors
                with different cooking methods. Later, the immigrants from the
                Central Plains continued to move southward, bringing the Central
                Plains food style of "eating fine, never getting tired of food".
                The long years have enabled Guangdong to not only inherit the
                tradition of the food culture of the Central Plains, but also to
                draw on the essence of foreign and various aspects of cooking,
                and then according to local tastes, hobbies and habits, continue
                to absorb, accumulate, improve and innovate, thus forming
                dishes.
                <!--A wide variety of food features with sophisticated
                cooking, high quality and delicious taste. In the past 100
                years, it has become one of the most representative and
