    <b style="color:#1cba24;"align="left"; style="font-size:24px"> What is Trading Card?</b>
    
    <p align="justify"; class="one"> A trading card (or collectible card) is a small card, usually made out of paperboard or thick paper, which usually contains an image of a certain person, place or thing (fictional or real) and a short description of the picture, along with other text (attacks, statistics, or trivia).There is a wide variation of different types of cards. Modern cards even go as far as to include swatches of game worn memorabilia, autographs, and even DNA hair samples of their subjects.</p>
